## Tasks

* On start, ask for the user name
* Update name to display the entered player name
* Update enabled/disabled state for buttons depending on what their next option is (if moving right would go no-where, the button should be disabled)
* Update description based on player position
* The action button should only be enabled if an action can be performed on that screen
* When the player gets to the end you should be taken to a 'Congratulations' screen (which should display the number of chests collected and the total number of chests)
